# ConnectFour

Connect Four app for SalesLoft [Engineering Offline Exercise v2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ChozkkouQrRESGlvZYEM4sNAyks5mK-cAODGSKvgYjM/edit). For Level 1, this application will implement a CLI, two human player version of the [popular game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four). For Level 2, we will implement a simple AI. For Level 3 and beyond, this app will be part of an umbrella app. I will create an API via Phoenix that will interact with this module and serve data to a frontend SPA.
